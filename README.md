Constrained Non Linear Optimisation Problem for Solving Robotic Movement Problem

This program solves and plots the path taken to an optimum solution of a constrained non linear optimisation problem.
It uses a quadratic penalty function, the value of mu can be changed in the user input section of the code. 
The method for solving is a momentum based accelerated nestrov variation of the conjugate gradient method.
